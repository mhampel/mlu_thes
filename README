GETTING STARTED
===============

The LaTeX class mluthsis comes in two files:

    mluthsis.ins
    mluthsis.dtx

In order to create the files you need in order to use the
new class, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where
mluthsis.ins and mluthsis.dtx are located and run the
following set of commands:

    1.      latex mluthsis.ins
    2.      pdflatex mluthsis.dtx
    3.      makeindex -s gind.ist -o mluthsis.ind mluthsis.idx
    4.      makeindex -s gglo.ist -o mluthsis.gls mluthsis.glo
    5.      pdflatex mluthsis.dtx
    6.      pdflatex mluthsis.dtx

Doing so will fill your directory with alot of files.
You will need the following:

    mluthsis.pdf
        This file is the class' documentation and contains all
        the information there is concerning the mluthsis class.
        An already compiled copy of this file should be in the
        original folder where you found mluthsis.ins and
        mluthsis.dtx.

    mluthsis.cls
        This file is the class file which you will need to
        use the mluthsis class.

Now you have all you need. To typeset your own document with
the mluthsis class, simply copy your mluthsis.cls file into
the folder of your actual LaTeX-Poject or - if you don't want
to do copy it every time you create a LaTeX-document using
this class - simply put it into a directory that is searched
by LaTeX at run.
